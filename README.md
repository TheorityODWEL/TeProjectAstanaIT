# TeProjectAstanaIT
This project I did for my assignment, and yes I hate the web develeopment and do know nothing about it

1. To start project in VSCode dowload the file. Open The TE_project folder in vs code, install requirements.txt
2. Then go to the event_map_backend, using the "cd event_map_backend".
3. Write in terminal "uvicorn main:app --reload", to start fastaApi server
4. Press the http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in the terminal
5. app is open
6. Just press "Sign In", (it doesn't have real funtionality)


GOOD LUCK!!!
